Description

This program is used to send an elevator to a user and send the user to the desired floor. It is based off a 10 floor building with a bank of two elevators.
Explain the purpose of your code/what it does. The code chooses which elevator is the correct elevator to send to the user. It also sends them to the correct floor and decides whether or not it would need to make stops along the way.




To run the tests:

Open Terminal

Enter: `npm test`
